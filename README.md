Deploying to https://tomf46.github.io/Appathematics/

Appathematics is a PWA (progressive web app) which allows you to race against the clock to answer randomly generated question sets usin of varying length, difficulty, and operators.

## Operators
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Powers
- Roots

## Custom set creation
As well as some pre set question sets you can also create your own sets using our custom set creation tools. Decide everything you want from the number of questions to, which numbers and operators(and how often) can be used to randomly generate questions.

This application is designed to work across multiple viewpoints and devices but is best enjoyed as a installed pwa on a device which supports PWAs fully which gives you an app icon on your home screen, and allows you to use it in offline mode.
